# Emotion-Classification
Welcome to the Emotion Prediction project! This repository contains a neural network-based model designed to classify emotions from text inputs. The model leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and BERT tokenization to accurately predict emotions such as happy, sad, and neutral.
